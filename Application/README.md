# Overview


Dash web-app that powers [NestGenerator.com](http://www.nestgenerator.com). The [app.py](https://github.com/perryrjohnson/Bird_DS/blob/master/Application/app.py) file contains the code for creating the web HTML layout and underlying calculations used to classify scooter's into nests. It then makes new nest location recommendations for the non-nest scooters which are generated from geolocation clustering.

## Components (not found on Github due to size restrictions)

* 'models' - The Pickled random forest models used in the web-application are too large for Github upload
* 'data' - Full datasets not added to Github due to size issues; however, important underlying data found in the data folder
